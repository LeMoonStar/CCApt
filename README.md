# CCApt
CCApt is a package manager for ComputerCraft, inspired by [APT (Advanced Package Manager)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)) for debian-based systems.

Its packet servers are just a simple file structure hosted over HTTP(S). Everyone is free to create their own packet servers and distribute their packets over them.
